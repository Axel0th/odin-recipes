    <h2 class="head1">Description</h2>
    <p>One of the ways to truly understand what Tunisian flavors are all about is to give a HUGE bite into a great Tunisian Fricassee roll. These traditional Tunisian rolls are made out of yeast dough and if you don’t think this is comforting enough, they are also deep-fried!!! Fricassees are usually stuffed with tuna, olives, Harissa, preserved lemons, hard-boiled egg and potatoes…. In other words a combo of flavors that is pure Tunisian goodness.</p>
    <h2 class="head2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10g fresh yeast or 14g active dried yeast</li>
        <li>240ml warm water</li>
        <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>500g strong white flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Oil for coating and frying For the tuna salad</li>
        <li>2 cans tuna packed in oil</li>
        <li>1 preserved lemon, removed flesh from the centre, peel finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 (or more) tsp ready-made harissa, taste before using</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp good quality mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="head3">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl dissolve the yeast in a 60ml warm water, add a pinch of sugar and wait until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt and make a well in the centre, add the remaining water, the yeast and egg. Mix to combine. You may need a bit more water — add just a tablespoon at a time, mixing and gathering in the dough, until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, or the dough hook of a stand mixer, knead the dough until smooth and elastic then place in a lightly oiled bowl, oiling the top of the dough as well, and cover with a tea towel. Leave to rise for about an hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Form into 10 small sausage shaped logs, and place on a well-oiled tray about 4cm apart (the dough will rise and spread), brush the top of the rolls with oil, cover the tray with a tea towel and let rise for another half hour.</li>
        <li>Pour about 5cm oil into a heavy-bottom frying pan or a deep fat fryer, heat to 180°C and fry the fricasse for about 3-5 minutes per side, until deep gold and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove and drain on paper towel or a rack. Once cooled, slice open horizontally and serve with Tunisian tuna salad, hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, readymade harissa, and olives – or any combination.</li>
        <li>To make the tuna salad: mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl.</li>
    </ol>
