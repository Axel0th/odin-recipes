    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to shape the Tunisian Fricassee. You can form small balls of dough, then flatten each ball into a thin disc. Gently stretch the disc of dough to give it an oval shape.
Another way to shape the Fricassee is the one shown in the picture below. Flatten the dough with a rolling pin, then use a round cookie cutter to cut out smalls discs of dough. Gently stretch each disc to give it an oval shape.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10g fresh yeast or 14g active dried yeast</li>
        <li>240ml warm water</li>
        <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>500g strong white flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Oil for coating and frying For the tuna salad</li>
        <li>2 cans tuna packed in oil</li>
        <li>1 preserved lemon, removed flesh from the centre, peel finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 (or more) tsp ready-made harissa, taste before using</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp good quality mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl dissolve the yeast in a 60ml warm water, add a pinch of sugar and wait until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt and make a well in the centre, add the remaining water, the yeast and egg. Mix to combine. You may need a bit more water — add just a tablespoon at a time, mixing and gathering in the dough, until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, or the dough hook of a stand mixer, knead the dough until smooth and elastic then place in a lightly oiled bowl, oiling the top of the dough as well, and cover with a tea towel. Leave to rise for about an hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Form into 10 small sausage shaped logs, and place on a well-oiled tray about 4cm apart (the dough will rise and spread), brush the top of the rolls with oil, cover the tray with a tea towel and let rise for another half hour.</li>
        <li>Pour about 5cm oil into a heavy-bottom frying pan or a deep fat fryer, heat to 180°C and fry the fricasse for about 3-5 minutes per side, until deep gold and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove and drain on paper towel or a rack. Once cooled, slice open horizontally and serve with Tunisian tuna salad, hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, readymade harissa, and olives – or any combination.</li>
        <li>To make the tuna salad: mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl.</li>
    </ol>
