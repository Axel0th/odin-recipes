    <img src="../images/coucous.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Couscous (Arabic: كُسْكُس, romanized: kuskus; Berber languages: ⵙⴽⵙⵓ, romanized: seksu) sometimes called kusksi or kseksu  is a traditional North African dishes of small steamed granules of rolled semolina that is often served with a stew spooned on top. Pearl millet, sorghum, bulgur, and other cereals are sometimes cooked in a similar way in other regions, and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.

        Couscous is a staple food throughout the Maghrebi cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco, and Libya. It was integrated into French and European cuisine at the beginning of the twentieth century, through the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs of Algeria.
        
        In 2020, couscous was added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <il>500 g couscous</il>
        <il>6 tablespoon olive oil (alternatively sunflower oil)</il>
        <il>1 tablespoon tomato paste</il>
        <il>1 teaspoon harissa</il>
        <il>3 onion (s)</il>
        <il>500 g meat your choice, lamb, beef or poultry, in bite-sized pieces</il>
        <il>3 clove (s) garlic</il>
        <il>2 potato (s)</il>
        <il>2 carrot (s)</il>
        <il>1 zucchini</il>
        <il>some pumpkin meat, optional</il>
        <il>200 g chickpeas, pre-cooked</il>
        <il>0.5 teaspoon ½ paprika powder</il>
        <il>1 teaspoon, heaped salt</il>
        <il>0.5 teaspoon ½ coriander powder</il>
        <il>0.5 teaspoon ½ pepper</il>
        <il>7 cup water</il>

        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <il>For the sauce, put the olive oil in a large saucepan so that the bottom is just covered. Then the meat should be fried in portions until golden brown on all sides. Then add a finely chopped onion and fry with it. Add tomato paste and harissa and fry well. Be careful, it shouldn`t turn too brown. Slowly add a little water - not too much, the tomato paste still needs to be roasted well. Keep adding a little water until your thick sauce is formed. Season to taste with the spices. Press the garlic and add it as well, take a little more if you like. Now a lot of water needs to be added - about 4 - 7 cups. It looks like a lot, but it has to be reduced again later anyway.</il>
        <il>Add the peeled potatoes, halved zucchini, about 2 onions and carrots. Now everything has to cook to itself. This can take a good 1 hour.</il>
        <il> In the meantime, the vegetables or meat may already be done (pierce lightly with a knife to test). If this is the case, carefully remove the meat or vegetables from the pot and cover well.</il>
        <il>Add the pre-cooked chickpeas. Now reduce the sauce until it has a fine, liquid consistency. It must not be thick or overly watery. Put the meat and vegetables back into the pot and let everything simmer again.</il>
        <il>Prepare the couscous according to the instructions on the packet, alternatively just moisten the couscous slightly and let it swell. It should then be cooked over the boiling sauce in a steamer insert for about 10-15 minutes.</il>
        <il>Put the couscous in a bowl, pour the finished sauce on it, stir well and let it steep for a moment. This is how the couscous soaks up the sauce.</il>
        <il>It is traditionally served in a large porcelain bowl. Place the vegetables and meat decoratively on top of the couscous.</il>
        <il>Tip: The dish can also be prepared vegetarian without meat.</il>
